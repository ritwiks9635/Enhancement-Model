Image enhancement is a process that improves the quality of an image, such as its resolution and contrast, to make it easier to interpret and analyze. It can also help remove unnecessary information and make images more useful for machine vision tasks. Image enhancement can be achieved using computational methods in the spatial or transform domain. Spatial domain methods can use global operations on the entire image or local operations on a neighborhood of each pixel. 

Some examples of image enhancement techniques include:

- **Filtering:** Using morphological operators, median filtering, or unsharp mask filtering
  
- **Histogram equalization:** Using contrast-limited adaptive histogram equalization (CLAHE)
  
- **Denoising:** Using a hybrid noise removing algorithm that combines Baye's shrink thresholding with directional filtering
  
- **Linear contrast adjustment:** Using negative and identity transformations
  
- **Deep neural networks:** Using AI-generated definitions
  
Image enhancement can be applied to many types of images, including photographs, medical images, and satellite images.
